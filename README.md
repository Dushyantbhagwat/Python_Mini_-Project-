# Job Portal Project

## 1. Problem Statement

The proposed job portal aims to address the challenges faced by the working class and job seekers. Despite their willingness to work and contribute, they encounter barriers such as limited access to suitable job opportunities, inadequate support for career advancement, and socio-economic disparities.

To bridge these gaps, a dedicated job portal is essential. It should provide access to a wide range of job opportunities, offer support services such as career guidance and skills development, and address socio-economic disparities.

By empowering job seekers to find meaningful employment that supports their well-being and that of their families, the portal aims to contribute to socio-economic advancement.
